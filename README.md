# ASCOMPentaxKPCameraDriver

ASCOM Driver for Pentax KP Camera

Developed by Richard Romano

# Testing

The software has only been tested with Sharpcap.  There is an issue changing Read Modes and Sharpcap is currently being updated.  After you change the Read Mode you must also update the Capture Area.

# Building and Installing

Build the solution in VS2015.  The dlls will automatically be registered.  This software is designed and tested in 64bit on Windows 11.

# Dependencies

The driver uses the Ricoh Camera SDK USB for .NET and uses LibRaw.

# Thanks

Special thanks to Doug Henderson the developer of the Sony Mirrorless Driver on which this work is based
