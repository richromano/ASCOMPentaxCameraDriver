# ASCOMSonyCameraDriver

ASCOM Driver for Sony Cameras

More info to come.  For now, see https://retro.kiwi/

## Dependencies
https://github.com/dougforpres/SonyCamera
A Windows DLL that communicates with compatible Sony cameras via USB
(see the [ChangeLog file](https://github.com/dougforpres/SonyCamera/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) in that repo for a list of major improvements.  This project only serves as an ASCOM front-end for that DLL)

## Wiki
This project has a [Wiki](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki) with a bunch of information covering:
* How to download the installer
* How to enable logging (if needed)
* Supported Cameras
* Some hints and tips

## Reporting Issues
Please do not use the GitHub "Issue" feature to report a problem (update - I've disabled it).  This is because GitHub's system refuses to email me when you create or update an issue.  It can take weeks or months for me to notice, and by then you've got upset with me not responding and are off telling your mates that I'm not being helpful.
Check out the Wiki (described above).  There is a page on Troubleshooting and Reporting a problem, along with a contact email address.
