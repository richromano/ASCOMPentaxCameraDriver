    <H3>Sony Mirrorless Camera ASCOM Driver</H3>
    This is an ASCOM driver for Sony Mirrorless cameras.
    The driver should actually work with any Sony camera that is supported by the <i>Sony Imaging Edge Remote</i> application.
    <br />
    Note that this driver was developed on Windows 10, with a Sony a6400 camera.  With the assistance of other Sony owners the driver now supports many Sony cameras.

    <h4>More Information Available Online</h4>
    The wiki for this project contains a list of currently supported cameras, some configuration hints for various AstroPhotography apps, help on troubleshooting, and other usful info.
    <a href="https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki">View to the Wiki on GitHub</a>.
    <br />
    To add support for your camera, please follow the instructions in the "Installation" section of the wiki.<br />

    <h4>Setting up the camera in APT</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Connect Camera via USB in <b>PC Remote</b> mode as if you were connecting it to the <i>Imaging Edge Remote</i> app.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the <i>Connect</i> button in APT (or Shift-click if a camera is already configured).
        </li>
        <li>
            Enable the <b>CCD</b> option and Choose <b>ASCOM Camera</b> from the drop-down list.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure the <i>Color FITS preview (de-Bayer)</i> is checked if you want RAW camera data, or unchecked if you want processed RGB data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click OK, an ASCOM dialog will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select <b>Sony Mirrorless Camera</b> from the drop-down and click <b>Properties...</b> (if you click OK at this point it will fail).
        </li>
        <li>
            The <i>Sony Mirrorless Setup</i> dialog will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose your camera from the dropdown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set "Target Application" to APT.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set "Image Output Format" to RGGB for RAW camera data, or RGB if you want processed RGB data (this should match the setting you chose in <i>Color FITS preview (de-bayer)</i> above)
        </li>
        <li>
            If your camera supports LiveView, and you want faster/low-res preview images, check <i>Use LiveView for preview mode</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Optional) Check the <b>Trace On</b> checkbox if you want the driver to write logs (logs will be required for any support issues).
        </li>
        <li>
            To have the raw image data from the camera saved to disk, check the appropriate box and enter the path to a directory you'd like to save the images to.  (No check is made to confirm this is a valid path, so do your own tests!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Press OK to close the box, then OK again to close the ASCOM dialog.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Your camera should now be connected - APT will remember the settings you chose and you'll only need to go through the setup steps if the driver is reinstalled/updated.
    <br />

    <h4>Setting up your camera:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mode should be set to a mode that supports <i>BULB</i> shooting - <i>M</i> (manual) is probably best.
        </li>
        <li>
            Exposure time should be set to <i>BULB</i> - if set to other than BULB the camera will still take shots, but it will ignore the exposure time requested by APT.
            (a future version will attempt to set BULB mode automatically)
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently all custom settings should be made on camera, APT currently has no control over ISO, Aperture, etc - in fact anything other than exposure time (in BULB mode).
        </li>
        <li>
            Image storage mode should be set to <i>RAW</i> (or possibly <i>RAW + JPEG</i>).
        </li>
        <li>
            For now, you should probably set your camera to save to camera + pc when in PC Remote mode (so you have access to the RAW data for editing).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>APT Supported features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Preview</b><br />Preview mode on the camera returns a low resolution JPEG encoded image to the driver.  This is decoded to an 8-bit per channel image and is displayed by APT.<br />
            The preview image in APT represents the same image as shown on the camera display (w/o any annotations/overlay).  This can be useful when using digital-zoom feature for focus assist, etc.<br />
            Note that when LiveView is enabled, the camera ignores shutter speed setting.  Setting a high ISO on the camera, and setting exposure time in APT to 0.000 will deliver better results (remember to re-set exposure time in APT when returning to normal shooting :) (I find this useful when using a bahtinov mask).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Shoot</b><br />Assuming camera is set to <i>BULB</i> mode, APT will take a shot of required duration, convert it from Sony's ARW RAW format to RGGB or RGB, and present at full-resolution to APT.
            If you chose RGGB and the debayer option in the camera-connect dialog the unprocessed RAW (RGGB) image will be saved to the FIT file (as monochrome).  It is up to you to manually debayer these images prior to processing.
        </li>
    </ul>
